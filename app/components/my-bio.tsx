        I'm a full stack developer with a back end leaning and a passion for crafting solutions that make a difference.
        Over the years, I've worked with Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, React, SQL and NoSQL databases, plus
        cloud platforms like AWS, building everything from startup MVPs to large scale systems for global companies.
        Based near Toronto in Canada, I love leading teams of engineers, shaping technical roadmaps, and getting hands
        on with code, whether it's a quick new project or a solid cloud solution. A drive to learn new things has kept
        me going through years of tech changes, and it's still what fires me up.

        Outside of code, I'm often on the mountain snowboarding in winter, playing tennis in summer, or chasing the
        perfect coffee brew any time of year. That mix of focus and curiosity shows up in my work, blending tech skills
        with a touch of creativity. Want to chat? Try my personal chatbotâ€”ask me about my experience, the best powder
        day, my go-to coffee, or just how bad my tennis serve is :)
